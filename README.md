# make secure SSH connection for remote file exchanging

Making SSH connection between two machines could be very useful as it opens a wide range of possibilities. You can see all files on your PC, can remotly make a new file, edit existing files or download any. 
This is a guide how to establish a test SSH connection between two Ubuntu virtual machines. 

In my case (I'm using VirtualBox 7.0.18) to make 2 virtual machines see each other I need to make custom NAT network at path file-tools-networkTool-create NATnetwork and enter IP address, eg 192.168.100.0/24.
